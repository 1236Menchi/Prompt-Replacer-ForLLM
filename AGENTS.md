# Contributor Guidelines

- Use two spaces for indentation in all files.
- Keep the browser extension free of external communications. Do not add network
  requests or remote script loads.
- Before committing, run `npm test`. If a lint script exists, also run
  `npm run lint`.
- Document any new commands or project-specific procedures in this file.
